# File Transfer Projcet

This project demonstrates a simple client-server file transfer system using C programming language.

The main components are:
<ul>
<li>A bash script (run.sh) - automates the process of compiling both server and client files.</li>
<li>A server (server.o) - listens for incoming clients, and sends a simple file text.</li>
<li>A client (client.o) - connects to the server and receives a file.</li>
</ul>

Run the program using the following commands:
<ul>
cd Tests
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
</ul>
