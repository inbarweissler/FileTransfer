# File Transfer Projcet

This project demonstrates a simple client-server file transfer system using C programming language.

Main components are:
A bash script (run.sh) - automate the process of compiling both server and client files.
A server (server.o) - listens for incoming clients, and sends a simple file text.
A client (client.o) - connects to the server and receives a file.

Run the program using the following commands:
cd Texts
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
